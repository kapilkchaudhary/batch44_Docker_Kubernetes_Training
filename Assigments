Q1:- Write a common use-case, where you will use a daemon set instead of replica set.
Daemon Sets we are using where we required to configure some prerequiste configurations at the time of the creation of the nodes, For example we want to run logger should run each and every node of the cluster in that case we will run logger as a daemon sets in our enviorements.
While as with the help of Replica sets, Kubernetes gives us the gurantee to run (number which we have given in RS) pods at every given point of time. For example we are runinng one web app service where we have given RS as 2 in the deployment so in that case Kubernetes gives us assurity that any point of given time 2 pods of our webapp application is running int he cluster.

Q2:- Suppose you have deployed your application using a deployment controller. Assume the initial number of replicas is one. Write the steps needed to update a container's image using deployment, making sure that there is zero downtime.
kubectl edit deployment 
and then change the image 

Q3:-You have deployed an application, that is listening at port 8000. You used a replica-set to deploy it and created a NodePort service to make it accessible. But when you test it, somehow the application is not reachable at the port. Write down your approach and sequentially all the steps that you will take to find out the issue.
1:- Check for the nodeport in the Service you have given.
2:- Check whether correct node port you are giving on the time you are trying to access the same.
3:- If still issue persists check whether your node port service is properlly created or not 
4:- look out for some Systax issues 

Q4:- Voting App Demo

Observation:- 
  New container get created, becuase we have given RS as 1 in our deployment
	Still voting app is accessible
	No problem in no. of votes
  Whole Application is working fine 
  
2:- delete worker pod

Observation:- 
Voting app is accessible 
Number of Votes are also correct 
worker pod able to pull data from DB
Application is working fine
As new Worker pod has created so we lost the old logs

3:- Delete db pod

Observations:-

Impact on Result pod, data got deleted 
db pod able to connect and do the insertion of votes
connection to result app is ended 
Socket has not established
impact seen on Result pod

4:- To Start the result app 
        Socket connection should be established with Result Pod 
				For the same we need to restart the Result pod because Socket connection imbibe in the POD creation yaml of the same.
